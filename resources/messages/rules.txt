1) Voice/Text Chat:  TS for voice for raids, Discord for text chat (and for voice if you really want to for side grouping.) Please make sure that your Discord and TS tags correspond to your in-game @name so we know who you are for signups. 
2) Activity:  Get raiding Skeevers -- if you haven’t attended a regularly scheduled raid in your first month of activity you risk being removed from the guild. (And if you haven’t, why not?  Isn’t that why you joined?!)  After your first raid, you will be promoted to Zombie rank.  All Zombie rank and above members are expected to attend a raid at least once every two months. If you do not, you will risk being removed from the guild.   But of course, if you need to take a leave of absence during this time, please let an officer know.
3) Raid Signups: Sign up for open raids in the #all-raid-signups channel.  Signups will open approximately 24 hours before a raid.  Signup format instructions are pinned to the channel.  Please do not sign up unless you actually intend to attend the raid.  Repeated withdrawals/no-shows may result in Severe Punishment (™) (i.e., suspension of raiding privileges).  Conversely, if you would like to attend a raid and it is full, sign up anyway as overflow and if anyone withdraws or no-shows, overflows will have their spots in order of signup.
4) Ranks:  Skeevers, you get that by joining. Zombies, you get that by showing up to a scheduled raid.  The Big Epeen Ranks (™) are based on either your proven ability to act in a support role (Plague Doctor for healers and Bone Wall for tanks) or your dps parse (Dragur @ 27K, Bone Colossus @ 32K ).  To be promoted based on a dps parse, please submit a screenshot of your parse on a 6 mil dummy self buffed, no Lover Stone.
