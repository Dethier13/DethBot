1) Voice/Text Chat:  Discord. Please make sure that your Discord name correspond to your in-game @name so we know who you are for signups. 
2) Activity:  Get raiding! -- if you haven’t attended a regularly scheduled raid in a month you risk being removed from the guild. (And if you haven’t, why not?  Isn’t that why you joined?!)   But of course, if you need to take a leave of absence during this time, please let an officer know.
3) Raid Signups: Sign up for open raids in the #all-raid-signups channel.  Signups will open approximately 24 hours before a raid.  Signup format instructions are pinned to the channel.  Please do not sign up unless you actually intend to attend the raid.  Repeated withdrawals/no-shows may result in Severe Punishment (:tm:) (i.e., suspension of raiding privileges).  Conversely, if you would like to attend a raid and it is full, sign up anyway as overflow and if anyone withdraws or no-shows, overflows will have their spots in order of signup.
3.5) Raids are restricted based on your discord roles, you will NOT be able to signup unless you have the corresponding rank for that raid night.
