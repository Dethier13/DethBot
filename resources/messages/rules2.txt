5) Guild Hall:  Set crafting stations for all the sets you likely need, a transmute station, training dummies and all the mundus stones you should need.  Visit @Mrrlyn’s permanent residence to experience the experience.
6) Shit Talking:  A certain amount of good natured trolling is permitted.  But under no circumstances is harassment of any kind tolerated. Act like the adults you pretend to be on the internet.
7) Misc: Raid Notifier and Combat Metrics addons and Discord voice downloaded and turned on for all training raids
8) Raid/Guild Etiquette: **NO LOOT SPYING**, only ask for gear that has been linked in chat by others, otherwise assume they want the gear.
                        No **Selling** gear in guild runs. We are all guildies, don't be that asshole charging his friends for gear just cuz you got lucky...
                        If you have any issues in a raid, contact the raid leader for them to address it, do not address it yourself.
                        If you have any issues in the guild, contact Guild leadership (Lich/Lich King) and they will take care of it, that's their *job*.  
                        This is a training guild, you are expected to be able to receive critique's/advice from those more experienced in your role so that you can improve
9) You can only signup as a healer for raids 2x a week so we can give others a chance
