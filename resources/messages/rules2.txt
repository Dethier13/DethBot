	4.5)Lorkhan’s Will (Progression Core):  For those interested in consideration for a substitute spot on our progression team Lorkhan’s Will, once you have reached the maximum rank of your role (e.g., Bone Colossus, Bone Wall, Plague Doctor), please reach out to @Dethier to discuss.  
5) Guild Hall:  Set crafting stations for all the sets you likely need, a transmute station, training dummies and all the mundus stones you should need.  Visit @Mrrlyn’s permanent residence to experience the experience.
6) Shit Talking:  A certain amount of good natured trolling is permitted.  But under no circumstances is harassment of any kind tolerated. Act like the adults you pretend to be on the internet.
7) Misc: Please make sure you have TS installed before your first raid and that it works. If you need someone to help you test it or have questions, please ask BEFORE the raid :).  Also, please make sure you have the addon Raid Notifier installed before raids.
